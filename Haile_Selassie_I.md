> Haile Selassie I (born Tafari Makonnen or Lij Tafari; 23 July 1892 – 27 August 1975) 
> was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974. 
> He rose to power as the Regent Plenipotentiary of Ethiopia (Enderase) under Empress Zewditu between 1916 and 1930.
>
> Widely considered to be a defining figure in modern Ethiopian history, 
> he is accorded divine importance in [[../../../../../Philosophy/Metaphysic/Religion/Abrahamic_Religion/Rastafari|Rastafari]], an [[../../../../../Philosophy/Metaphysic/Religion/Abrahamic_Religion|Abrahamic_Religion]] that emerged in the 1930s. 
> 
> A few years before he began his reign over the Ethiopian Empire, 
> Selassie defeated Ethiopian army commander Ras Gugsa Welle Bitul, nephew of Empress Taytu Betul, 
> at the Battle of Anchem. 
> 
> He belonged to the Solomonic dynasty, founded by Emperor Yekuno Amlak in 1270.
>
> Selassie, seeking to modernise Ethiopia, introduced political and social reforms 
> including the 1931 constitution and the abolition of slavery in 1942. 
> 
> He led the empire during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, and after its defeat was exiled to the United Kingdom. 
> When the Italian occupation of East Africa began, he traveled to Anglo-Egyptian Sudan 
> to coordinate the Ethiopian struggle against Fascist Italy; 
> he returned home after the East African campaign of World War II. 
> 
> He dissolved the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1950, 
> and annexed Eritrea as one of Ethiopia's provinces, while also fighting to prevent Eritrean secession. 
> 
> As an internationalist, Selassie led Ethiopia's accession to the United Nations. 
> In 1963, he presided over the formation of the Organisation of African Unity, the precursor of the African Union, 
> and served as its first chairman. 
> 
> By the early 1960s, prominent African socialists such as Kwame Nkrumah 
> envisioned the creation of a "United States of Africa". 
> Their rhetoric was anti-Western; Selassie saw this as a threat to his alliances. 
> He attempted to influence a more moderate posture within the group.
>
> Amidst popular uprisings, Selassie was overthrown by the Derg in the 1974 Ethiopian coup d'état. 
> With support from the Soviet Union, the Derg began governing Ethiopia as a Marxist–Leninist state. 
> In 1994, three years after the fall of the Derg military junta, it was revealed to the public 
> that the Derg had assassinated Selassie at the Jubilee Palace in Addis Ababa on 27 August 1975. 
> On 5 November 2000, his excavated remains were buried at the Holy Trinity Cathedral of Addis Ababa.
>
> Among adherents of Rastafari, Selassie is called the returned Jesus, 
> although he was an adherent of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church himself. 
> 
> He has been criticised for his suppression of rebellions among the landed aristocracy (Mesafint), 
> which consistently opposed his changes. 
> 
> Others have criticised Ethiopia's failure to modernise rapidly enough. 
> During his reign, the Harari people were persecuted and many left their homes. 
> His administration was criticised as autocratic and illiberal by groups such as Human Rights Watch. 
> 
> According to some sources, late into Selassie's administration, 
> the Oromo language was banned from education, public speaking and use in administration, 
> though there was never a law that criminalised any language. 
> His government relocated many Amhara people into southern Ethiopia.
